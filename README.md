# ALLDJ Music Collection

A personal music collection management system with metadata tracking and analysis tools.

## Contents

- `music_collection_metadata.json` - Main metadata file containing track information
- `clean_tags.py` - Python script for cleaning and organizing music tags
- `notes.txt` - Collection notes and documentation
- `tag taxonomy.txt` - Tag classification system
- `tag-analyzer-ts/` - TypeScript-based tag analysis tools

## Audio Files

The actual audio files (`flac/` directory) are not included in this repository due to size constraints (28GB+) and copyright considerations. The repository focuses on metadata management and analysis tools.

## Usage

The metadata file tracks information about the music collection including artists, albums, genres, and custom tags for DJ/music analysis purposes.
